#Build a Portfolio Site

This is a project done by Unnar Thor Bachmann in the Udacity's front-developing course.

This project involves building a portfoli site. I selected to use the Bootstrap framwork to complete this project.

##How to run the webpage.

1. Open the index.html file in the project folder in a web browser to run the website.
